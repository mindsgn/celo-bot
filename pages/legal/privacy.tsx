          <strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have

        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the
          collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
          province
        </li>

      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons

        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will

        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any

        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.

        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we

        <strong>*In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European
        Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights
        that allow you greater access to and control over your personal

        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights

        to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii)
        to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of
        your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
        processing your personal information, you also have the right to
        complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can

        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your
        consent to process your personal information, which may be express
        and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
        right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
        consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details

        NOTICE?&#39; below.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
        reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &#39;HOW
        CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&#39; below. You will then be
        removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with

        service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

        <strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&#39;DNT&#39;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
        notice.

        <strong>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</strong>

        to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and
        delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided
        by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of
        his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting
        from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to
        protect against illegal activities.
      </p>
      <p>Right to be informed — Request to know</p>
      <p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
        <li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
        <li>

      <p>
        In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or

        Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy
        Rights

      <p>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</p>
      <p>We do not process consumer&#39;s sensitive personal information.</p>
      <p>Verification process</p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.

        <li>
          You can designate an authorised agent to make a request under the CCPA
          on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that
          does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on
          your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
        </li>
        <li>
