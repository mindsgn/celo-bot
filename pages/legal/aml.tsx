        Anti-Money Laundering Policy: Compliance and Supervisory Procedures
      </h1>
      <p>UPDATED AS OF 18 January 2022.</p>
      <p>1.</p>
      <h2 id="multiplada-ltd-policy">Multiplada Ltd Policy</h2>
      <p>
        It is the policy of the Multiplada Ltd to prohibit and actively prevent
        money laundering and any activity that facilitates money laundering or
        the funding of terrorist or criminal activities. Multiplada Ltd takes a
        zero tolerance approach to being involved in illegal/illicit activity,
        and will fully comply with all relevant sections of the Money Laundering
        Regulations 2017 (ML Regs) (as amended by the MLR 2019), the Proceeds of
        Crime Act 2002 (POCA), and the Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT).
      </p>
      <p>
        POCA applies to everyone but certain issues related to money laundering
        only apply to those engaged in activities in the &quot;regulated
        sector&quot;. Multiplada Ltd does not make any represetations of whether
        it falls in that sector as it does not interface with FIAT currencies.
        However, to ensure the highest standard of legal compliance Multiplada
        LTD still has in place certain anti-money laundering policies, controls
        and procedures to anticipate and prevent the site being used by
        criminals to launder money and fund terrorism as well as ensure that the
        ownership and control of any company, legal arrangement or trust
        structure of a customer is identified and verified. There is more
        information on both HMRC and the National Crime Agency&#39;s websites as
        to which businesses fall within the &quot;regulated&quot; sector and
        what procedures these businesses must follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the 2019 Regulations prescribe mandatory enhanced due diligence
        measures when a transaction appears to be &quot;high risk&quot;,
        Multiplada Ltd takes care of such situations, even when a business is
        otherwise not within the remit of a regulated sector and otherwise
        considered &quot;low risk&quot;. This has been done as a matter of good
        practice. If enhanced due diligence is required, customers may wish to
        seek independent specialist legal advice due to the serious civil and
        criminal penalties that can result from failure to comply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that as the 2019 Regulations widen the scope of &quot;obliged
        entities&quot; subject to them, this template policy is not suitable for
        those businesses that engage in platforms related to virtual currencies,
        those who deal in the art market or handle or issue pre-paid electronic
        cards. Estate Agents and Lettings Agents should use the AML Policy
        templates specifically created for them in the Property portfolio of
        templates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to
        conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so
        that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or
        constitute legitimate assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of types of fraudulent activities include insider trading,
        market manipulation, ponzi schemes, cybercrime and other
        investment-related fraudulent activity. Multiplada Ltd does not provide
        any opportunity for a user to be even capable of any of the above crimes
        through its site as the site is a hobbyist site, not meant for financial
        investing nor is it any scheme or have any relation with fiat
        currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our AML policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to
        ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and and will be
        reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate policies,
        procedures and internal controls are in place to account for both
        changes in regulations and changes in our business.
